# The Nick Shabazz EDC Disassembly Gear Toolholder

A Gem of a Tool-Holder for keeping a variety of EDC gear disassembly tools at hand

### Tools

This is designed to hold a variety of tools showcased at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EapUzmSoLFA> and linked to on http://nickshabazz.com/tools .  Your toolage may vary.

### Using the STL

The STL file is ready-to-print and includes the gem insignia, just use your slicer/gcode generator of choice.  The _large file also includes a place for Cotton Swabs and rubbing alcohol.

### Using the OpenSCAD .scad file

The scad file is designed to be opened using OpenSCAD <https://openscad.org/>, and allows you to modify the design to suit your own needs.  The gem logo is not included, but you can create your own SVG file and substitute it in where gemonly.svg lives in the source code.

### Printing the toolholder

You'll have to do this yourself.  No, I'd rather not print it for you, printing and shipping these takes too much time and I'd have to charge you far more than it's worth.  You can find plenty of companies that print stl files for you.

### Known issues

- I could go with a tighter fit on the drivers, but not sure what kind of tolerance to expect.
